./monctl.py runs in either of two modes:

(M1) ./monctl.py start|stop 
     routine mode to launch and terminate the monitor processs
     default mode is routine

(M2) ./monctl.py <ver>
     release mode
     - determine which monitors are running (ignore if new_version running)
     - terminate current monitor processes, 
       - track and retry termination for multiple processes per instrument
         - terminate parent first
           - wait (longer for drp processes)...
           - if child process(es) do not terminate, terminate them
     - install new version (what if activating older version?)
       - if new_ver DNE (reverting to previous or other version)
         - mkdir <new_ver>
         - cp -pr cur_ver/ new_ver/
         - verify with diff
       - else
         - unlink default
         - ln -s ... default
     - launch new default version of monitors
